# Transfer-Learning-with-VGG16
This project applies transfer learning using the VGG16 architecture for an image classification task. The pre-trained VGG16 model (trained on ImageNet) is used as a base, and its top layers are fine-tuned to adapt to the custom dataset.
For this project, a dataset from Kaggle has been utilized: Dogs vs. Cats Dataset. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogsvscats)
